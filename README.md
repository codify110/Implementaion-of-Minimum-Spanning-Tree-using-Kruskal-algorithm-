# Implementaion-of-Minimum-Spanning-Tree-using-Kruskal-algorithm-
Write a program which will input Graph in form of adjacency matrix and starting node, your program should display MST using Kruskal Algorithm

## What is MST(Minimum Spanning Tree)?
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

## What is KRUSKAL ALGORITHM?
Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum cost spanning tree uses the greedy approach. This algorithm treats the graph as a forest and every node it has as an individual tree. A tree connects to another only and only if, it has the least cost among all available options and does not violate MST properties.
